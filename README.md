# GianBOT Deep Seek Personal Chatbot

Welcome to the **GianBOT Deep Seek Personal Chatbot** repository. This project is a demonstration of how to integrate and fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for small, targeted tasks, showcasing advanced API integrations and prompt engineering techniques.

## Overview

**GianBOT** is an AI-powered chatbot built on the Deep Seek model (derived from LLaMA 70B). It is fine-tuned to provide detailed and accurate information about Gian Marco Innocenti by leveraging a carefully curated dataset. The chatbot uses a streamlined API-based approach, making it an excellent example of adapting powerful LLMs to specific, context-driven applications.

## Key Features

- **Deep Seek Model**: Utilizes a fine-tuned LLaMA 70B-based model to deliver precise and context-specific answers.
- **API Integration**: Demonstrates robust API usage to interact with the LLM, ensuring smooth and reliable communication.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Features a dynamic, conversational interface built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
- **Custom Prompt Engineering**: Leverages effective prompt design to ensure responses are both accurate and context-aware.
- **Lightweight & Focused**: Designed for targeted tasks, showcasing how big models can be fine-tuned for small, personal projects.
